Installation
========================================================
Hopefully this won't take long! MRMR is not yet on CRAN. This means it needs to be sourced from GitHub. Hopefully you've already done that.
If you haven't, and we all have a good internet connection, this will only take a moment.

You may also need to install some support libraries: ggplot2, reshape2, plyr, lubridate, RColorBrewer
