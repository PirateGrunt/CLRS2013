        Workshop instructions</h1>
        <p>These instructions apply for the third and final part of the workshop. 
        You should have received a complete set of instructions, for this section and the others, from the CAS. 
        Please contact them with any questions.</p>
        
        <p>To be able to participate in this section of the workshop, you will need to download and install the 
          R package MRMR. In addition, you will probably want to make a copy of the R script which will produce the 
          examples which we will discuss.
        </p>

        <p>To install MRMR, first download a copy of the package. Press the button above marked "MRMR". 
        (It's the button with the picture of a package and the letters "GZ".)</p>
        
        <p>Before installing, note soemthing important. MRMR depends on the ggplot2 package to function. At least one 
        user reported issues installing MRMR because ggplot2 had not installed properly. Before installing MRMR, confirm
          that ggplot2 has been properly installed by issuing the following command at the R console: <code>print(require(ggplot2))</code> If
          you do not see TRUE as a result, then you may need to install several report tables which ggplot2 requires. Those packages may include
          any of the following: <code>gtable, labeling, munsell</code>.
        </p>
        
        <p>Does ggplot2 work? Good. We're ready to install MRMR.</p>
        
        <p>From within R Studio, perform the following command:</p>
        
        <p><code>install.packages("SOME_DIRECTORY/Downloads/MRMR_CLRS.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")</code></p>
        <p>where SOME_DIRECTORY is the directory where the file has been downloaded.</p>
        
        <p>Note that you may also install the package via the user interface.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>From the "Tools" menu, click "Install Packages".</li>
          <li>If necessary, change the "Install from" option to "Package Archive File (.zip; .tar.gz)</li>
          <li>Click the "Browse" button and navigate to the location where you have downloaded the file "MRMR_CLRS.tar.gz".</li>
          <li>Click the "Install" button</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Whichever method you choose, you may ensure that the package has been properly installed by issuing the 
        following command at the R console: <code>print(require(MRMR))</code>.</p>
        <p>You should see TRUE displayed as the output at the console. If you do not, please contact Brian for help:

          <p>You may also download the script which we will go over during the presentation and a copy of the presentation itself.</p>
